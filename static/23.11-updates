- Changed my /etc/nixos/flake.nix's ``nixpkgs.url`` to
  ``github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11`` and ``home-manager.url`` to
  ``github:nix-community/home-manager/release-23.11``.

- Ran ``nixos-rebuild`` and dealt with issues as they occurred:

  - Added an electron and python version to permittedInsecurePackages

  - Squashed a warning by renaming an NixOS option: changed fonts.fonts to
    fonts.packages

  - python38 and python39 failed to build with the same sort of Sphinx error so
    temporarily disabled their builds until I have time to figure the issue out.

- Once nixos-rebuild finished, and I restarted, had these issues:

  - ``emacsclient`` would not open, giving this: ``*ERROR*: Display :0 canâ€™t be
    opened``.  I have emacs installed via home-manager, and after making
    this change::

      -  services.emacs.enable = true;
      +  services.emacs = {
      +    enable = true;
      +    startWithUserSession = "graphical";
      +  };

    It worked.  This changes ``wantedBy=default.target`` to
    ``wantedBy=graphical-session.target`` in the emacsclient systemd user
    service file.

    If you install the emacs service via nixpkgs rather than home-manager, a
    similar option exists to services emacs something like
    ``services.emacs.startWithGraphical = true'``.

    Something must have changed with the systemd initalization order or the X
    startup process under 23.11 for this to be necessary.
